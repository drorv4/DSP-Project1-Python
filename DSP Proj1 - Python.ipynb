    "#### Background:\n",
    "This project is concerned with the implementation of mathematical graphs and their usages. The basic definition of a graph is a set of nodes where some pairs of nodes are connected by edges, and where these edges have weights. Each edge of the graph has a direction so by default a graph is directional. If there is an edge directed from node A to node B, then we say that B is a neighbor of A (i.e., B is connected to A), and we note that this does not necessarily mean that A is a neighbor of B. However, if all the edges come in “pairs” (namely, if X is a neighbor of Y, then Y is also a neighbor of X), then we say that the graph is non-directional.\n",
